        <p>
          I’m a passionate frontend developer focused on creating clean, modern,
          and responsive interfaces that improve user experience. I enjoy
          learning new technologies and improving with every project.

        <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
        <p>
          My goal is to sharpen my frontend skills, especially in accessibility,
          semantic HTML, and responsive design — to become a stronger, more
          industry-ready developer.

        <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
        <p>
          I sometimes struggle with deep CSS layouts and advanced animations,
          but I’m working to improve those through consistent practice.
